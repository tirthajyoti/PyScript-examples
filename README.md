Examples of web pages developed with PyScript framework

## What is PyScript?
From their [Github repo](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript)
> PyScript is a meta project that aims to combine multiple open technologies to create a framework for users to use Python (and other languages) to create sophisticated applications in the browser. It highly integrates with the way the DOM works in the browser and allows users to add logic, in Python, in a way that feels natural to web as well as Python developers.

## No installation needed
To write Python code inside your HTML, just add these assets in your script inside the `<head>...</head>`
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css" />
